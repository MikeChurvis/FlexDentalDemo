# Flex Dental Demo

This is the codebase for my pre-interview demonstration for Flex Dental. On its surface, it's a simple To-Do app. Behind the scenes, it's a demonstration.

## Parts

There are three parts:

1. A To-Do list app written in Ember.
2. A suite of E2E Playwright tests that cover the Ember app's behavior.
3. A React app built with TDD against those same exact Playwright tests.
