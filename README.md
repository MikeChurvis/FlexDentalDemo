# Flex Dental Demo

This is the codebase for my pre-interview demonstration for Flex Dental. On its surface, it's a simple To-Do app. Behind the scenes, it's much more.

There are three parts:

1. An EmberJS version of the app.
2. A suite of Playwright tests that cover the Ember app's behavior end-to-end.
3. A React app built against those same exact Playwright tests using TDD.
